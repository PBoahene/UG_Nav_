## üìå Overview

**UG Navigate** is a campus navigation system designed as a Data Structures and Algorithms group project (DCIT 204, University of Ghana). It helps users find:
- The shortest path between two locations
- Alternate route options
- Routes through selected landmarks
- Estimated travel times (considering traffic)
- A visual map with the selected route drawn

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### üîß Compile
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PBoahene/UG_Nav.git
cd UG_Nav
```

```bash
javac --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls *.java
```

# Open the project in your IDE.

Add VM Options: Configure your IDE to run the project with the following VM arguments. You must replace /path/to/javafx-sdk-19/lib with the actual path to the lib folder inside your extracted JavaFX SDK.

```bash
text
--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-19/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
```
In IntelliJ: Run -> Edit Configurations -> Modify options -> Add VM options.

### üó∫Ô∏è How to Use
Launch the application.

The main map view will load. You can pan around by dragging the mouse.

Use the search bar to type the name of a location (e.g., "JQB", "Balme Library").

Select your desired destination from the dropdown results.

Click "Get Directions". The path will be drawn on the map, and a list of instructions will appear.

(Optional) Click on the star icon next to a location to add it to your Favorites.

 ## üôè Acknowledgments
